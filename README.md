# Codes for my engineering thesis

In this repository you will find codes that I used for my engineering thesis. The thesis is about the RSA cryptosystem and some attacks on it.  
Under ssl_attack you will find Rust code with some examples and a half implemented Bleichebacher choosen ciphertext attack.  
Under WebServer you will find the server that I used as an example of a vulnerable server.  
I am including the version of WolfSSL that I used for it. It has to be manually compiled and installed in order to be used since I did not change file inclusion 
in the server to be relative. WolfSSL is licensed under the GNU general public license v2.0. You can find it in its folder.
